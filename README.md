# Ruby Challenges

This repository holds the Ruby pair programming challenges for the 2023 Foxtrot cohort.

### Process Notes

- Anything wrapped in `< >` is an indication that this will be named uniquely, the `< >` are NOT included in the command
- `$` is an indication of a command line prompt, the `$` is not included
- Anything in `( )` is informational and not included in the command
- The term local/locally your personal computer
- The term remote means GitHub

### Naming Conventions

Branches and file names should be in all lowercase letters with no spaces:

- Branch name: `topic-initials1-initials2` (ex. methods-cb-nmr)
- File name: `topic-name1-name2.rb` (ex. methods-charlean-nicole.rb)

### Informational Commands

Use this informational command to tell you what files have been modified and what phase of the git process you are on:

- $ `git status`

Use this informational command to see what branch you are currently on:

- $ `git branch`

### Cloning the Repo

Use this command if you don't have the repository (folder) on your local machine:

- $ `git clone <repo-url>` (the url is pasted from copy icon on GitHub)

### Create a Branch

Use this command if you need to create a branch that does not exist anywhere:

- $ `git checkout -b <topic-initials1-initials2>` (ex. arrays-cb-nmr)

### Changing to a Local Branch

Use this informational command to see what branches exist on your local machine:

- $ `git branch`

Use this command to move to a branch that exist on your local machine:

- $ `git checkout <branch-name>`

### Changing to a Remote Branch

Use these commands if the repo you are working on has a branch but it is NOT on your local machine:

- $ `git fetch origin <branch-name>`
- $ `git checkout <branch-name>`

### Pushing Local Code to GitHub

Use these commands to add the code you have on your local machine to GitHub:

- $ `pwd` (ensure you are in the repository level)
- $ `git status` (informational command, ensure you are on the correct branch and in the correct directory)
- $ `git add <file-name>`
- $ `git commit -m "message describing the work that was accomplished"`
- $ `git push origin <branch-name>`

### Pulling Remote Code to Local

Use this command if you DO have the repository on your local machine but DON'T have the latest version of the code from GitHub:

- $ `git pull origin <branch-name>`

### Deleting a Branch on GitHub

Branches exist on your local and on the remote. Always delete your branch in both places.

- Branches in GitHub can be deleted via the GUI

### Deleting a Branch on Local

Branches exist on your local and on the remote. Always delete your branch in both places.

- $ `git checkout main`
- $ `git pull origin main`
- $ `git branch -d <branch-name>`
